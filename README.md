Cosmatic Drift is a HRP fork of Station 14 that runs on [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox), their homegrown engine written in C#.

This is the primary repo for Cosmatic Drift. To prevent people forking RobustToolbox, a "content" pack is loaded by the client and server. This content pack contains everything needed to play the game on one specific server.

If you want to host or create content for SS14, this is the repo you need. It contains both RobustToolbox and the content pack for development of new content packs.

Just make sure your changes and pull requests are in accordance with the guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md

We are not currently accepting translations of the game on our main repository. If you would like to translate the game into another language consider creating a fork or contributing to a fork.

## Trieste Port

Trieste Port is a fork of Space Station 14, taking place on a ex-nanotrasen oil rig repurposed into a corporate-free safe haven on an outer-rim frontier ocean planet. It focuses on the daily lives of the citizens of Trieste, both above and beneath the waves. Citizens face dangers such as Nanotrasen infiltrators, pirates, horrific deep-sea fauna, and the crushing depths of the abyss. Enjoy the chaos and adventure as you carve your story across the rusted hull of the platform.

- If there are any issues with the link, ping Pixeltheaertist on the main SS14 discord

TRIESTE PORT is also open-source, so anyone is free to contribute to the project! If you have questions or need help, don't hesitate to ask in the discord!

I also absolutely don't mind if other forks wish to use our code for their own projects. After all, SS14 is all about collaboration! As long as it's not code ported over from another fork, of course. See attributions about that.

## Building

1. Clone this repo.
